## Introduction

This repository contains my solution to the Calculator App challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/calculator-app-9lteq5N29). The challenge was to build a functional and visually accurate calculator that supports multiple themes and essential mathematical operations.

## Overview

The primary goal of this project was to strengthen my **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** skills by creating a dynamic and interactive calculator. The focus was on usability, responsiveness, and smooth theme transitions.

## Features

- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.
- Fully functional calculator supporting basic arithmetic operations.
- Three distinct themes to personalize the user experience.
- Theme preference is saved in **local storage**, so it remains consistent across sessions.

## What I Learned

Through this project, I enhanced my ability to:

1. Implement **responsive layouts** for different devices.
2. Utilize **JavaScript** to handle calculations and manage state efficiently.
3. Work with **local storage** to preserve user preferences.
4. Improve **UI/UX** by providing smooth theme transitions.
